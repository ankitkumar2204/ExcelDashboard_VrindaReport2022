# E-Commerce Insights: Vrinda Stores Annual Report 2022

## Objective:
Varinda Store aims to compile a comprehensive annual sales report for 2022, seeking insights to better understand its customer base and strategize for increased sales in 2023.

### Sample Questions:
1. Compare monthly sales and orders in a single chart.
2. In 2022, Who purchased more- men or women?
3. What are the different order status in 2022?
4. List the top 7 states contributing to the sales.
5. Relation between age and gender based on number.
6. Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

## Data Analysis Process Include the following steps:
### [1] Data Cleaning:
In the context of the Vrinda Store project, data cleaning emerges as a crucial process, aimed at enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the information for optimal analysis and desired outcomes. The tasks involved encompass verifying column data types, eliminating unnecessary columns, introducing new columns as needed, and meticulously addressing duplicate and null values. The diligent execution of these data cleaning procedures lays the foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the data, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.

### [2] Data Processing:
In Data Processing we do some calculations so that it can help us to find the results.
In addressing problem statement: **2** of the project, I implemented an **IF Formula** to categorize individuals into specific age groups, providing valuable insights into the prime customers for Vrinda Store based on age and gender. This strategic approach aims to discern the target demographic and enhance the understanding of customer preferences for effective business optimization.

I effectively communicated the highest sales contributions from various channels and different order status in 2022 by utilizing a **Pie Chart** to address problem number **3** and **6** respectively.
I have proficiently utilized an alternative chart to analyze the top seven states contributing to sales, while also conducting a thorough examination of the interplay between age and gender to extract valuable insights from the sales data.

### [3] Data Analysis:
Data analysis involves the systematic cleaning, transformation, and processing of raw data to derive actionable and pertinent information, enabling businesses to make well-informed decisions. This method not only mitigates decision-making risks but also yields valuable insights and statistics, typically visualized through charts, images, tables, and graphs. As an integral part of the data analysis process, **Pivot Tables** play a crucial role in organizing and summarizing extensive datasets.
**Pivot tables** provide a dynamic tool for users to arrange and analyze data efficiently, facilitating a deeper understanding of patterns and trends essential for strategic decision-making within organizations.

### [4] Data Visualization:
Data visualization involves presenting data through visual elements like charts, plots, infographics, and animations, facilitating the communication of intricate data relationships and insights in a comprehensible manner. These graphical representations serve to simplify complex information, making it accessible and easily understandable.

Charts which I used in this projects are:
1. Bar Chart
2. Pie Chart
3. Line Chart
4. Clustered Column Chart
5. Combo Chart

### [5] Slicer:
I utilized Slicer functionalities, incorporating clickable buttons for efficient table and PivotTable filtering. Slicers not only facilitate rapid filtering but also visually convey the current filtering status, enhancing clarity regarding the displayed data subset.

### [6] Result:
